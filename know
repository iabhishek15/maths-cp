SOME IMPORTANT SERIES EXPANSION
  1) (1 + x) ^ n (https://undergroundmathematics.org/counting-and-binomials/r6295/solution)


IMPORTANT POINT
* finding primitive root
* finding primitive root of prime number  = https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/124408/finding-a-primitive-root-of-a-prime-number
* (a + b - 1) / b (for ceil function)
*  when multiplying if the value can be near about 10^18 make sure to divide since overflow can cause the problem (while multiplying)


EXTENDED EUCLID ALGORITHM
(a + b * x) % n == 0
not include the case when a % n == 0, making the new equation 
(b * x) % n == y 
condition gcd(b, n) = 1, we can get answer by extended euclid algorithm (ax + by = gcd(a, b))
