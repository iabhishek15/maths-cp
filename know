SOME IMPORTANT SERIES EXPANSION
  1) (1 + x) ^ n (https://undergroundmathematics.org/counting-and-binomials/r6295/solution)


IMPORTANT POINT
* (a + b - 1) / b (for ceil function)
*  when multiplying if the value can be near about 10^18 make sure to divide since overflow can cause the problem (while multiplying)


EXTENDED EUCLID ALGORITHM
(a + b * x) % n == 0
not include the case when a % n == 0, making the new equation 
(b * x) % n == y 
condition gcd(b, n) = 1, we can get answer by extended euclid algorithm (ax + by = gcd(a, b))

PRIMITIVE NUMBERS
* finding primitive root
* finding primitive root of prime number  = https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/124408/finding-a-primitive-root-of-a-prime-number
premitive numbers are numbers which have all remaindres less than p - 1 (here p is prime) when raised to [0, p - 2] power
How do we calcuate primitve number 
calculating number of primitive prime is just phie(phie(p)) {here phie is eulor totient to get the number of coprime with the number}
so value is phie(p - 1) since p i prime
for example 13 so p - 1 = 12 phie(12) (we will use prime) so phie(12) = (12) (1 - 1/2) (1 - 1/ 3) = 4
so there are 4 coprime numbers with 12 which are 1 3 7 11 , if we can get minimum primitive number we can raise this so power of
1 3 7 11 and take modulo ,with we will get the other primitive primes.
how to calculate minimum primitive prime ??
one ways if we raise every number power of 12 divided by all its factors and if we do not get the remainder 1 while taking mod with p then 
it is primitive root
12 / 2 = 6, 12 / 3 = 4, 12 / 4 = 3 (remainder 1)
12 = 2 * 3 * 4 * 6 /// 3^6 % p , 3 ^ 4 % p, 3 ^ 3 % p (iterate over 1 to 151 and check the values for this condition)
(may be we can get larger value than 151 when checking values less than 10^9)


BINOMIAL 
we can solve movement in grid (right or down with binomial coefficient) {n rows m col so choose(m + n, n) 
we have to move n steps to rigth and m steps down so we out of m + n steps we can choose any n steps to be right and rest to be 
down.
