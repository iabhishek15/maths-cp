SIMPLE ODD AND EVEN 
Even Odd Query - https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/even-odd-query/problem

IMPORTANT POINT
* finding primitive root
      -> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/primitive-problem/problem
*  when multiplying if the value can be near about 10^18 make sure to divide since overflow can cause the problem (while multiplying)
      -> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/leonardo-and-prime/problem (max number of prime)
      -> https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc169/tasks/abc169_b
 
 
 ********* FAST EXPONENTATION OR FAST POWER (The Russian Peasant Algorithm)
       -> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/russian-peasant-exponentiation/problem (using formula (a + bi)^k = c + di)
        (make sure to initialize the pair correctly(ans), look for overflow, look for negative value)
         
 ********WHEN THE VALUE OF MOD is greater than 10^9 
        was used in primarity testing
      -> https://www.spoj.com/problems/PON/ (prime or not)
 
 **********GCD
 basic gcd problem
   -> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/restaurant/problem (cutting square from rectangle)
   -> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/sherlock-and-gcd/problem
   -> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/possible-path/editorial (EUCLID ALGORITHM)
   -> atcoder 
   -> codechef

good basic geometry problem 
   -> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/sherlock-and-moving-tiles/problem (movement of square in a plane y = x)
   -> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/most-distant/problem (max_distance between points on x and y axis)
