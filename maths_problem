SIMPLE ODD AND EVEN 
Even Odd Query - https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/even-odd-query/problem

IMPORTANT POINT
* use pascal's triangle when mod is not prime and n <= 5000
* finding the primitive root
      -> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/primitive-problem/problem
*  when multiplying if the value can be near about 10^18 make sure to divide since overflow can cause the problem (while multiplying)

 ********* FAST EXPONENTATION OR FAST POWER (The Russian Peasant Algorithm)
       -> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/russian-peasant-exponentiation/problem (using formula (a + bi)^k = c + di)
        (make sure to initialize the pair correctly(ans), look for overflow, look for negative value)
         
 ********WHEN THE VALUE OF MOD is greater than 10^9 
        was used in primality testing
