 PROBLEM 1 -> Multiples of 3 and 5 (EASY)
 ques : we have to calculate sum of multiples of 3 & 5
 sol : use inclusion-exculison principle and (n * (n + 1)) / 2 by taking 5, 3, 15 as common.(AP can also be used to get the sum)
 
 PROBLEM 2 ->  Even Fibonacci numbers (EASY)
 ques even fibonaci number less than n 
 sol : generate all the fib less than max_value and just check the answer by iterating over values in fib
 
 PROBLEM 3 -> Largest prime factor (EASY)
 ques : largest prime factor of a number
 sol : just check all the prime factors and take the largest one
 
 PROBLEM 4 -> Largest palindrome product (EASY)
 ques : check for palidrome less than n made by multiplying two 3 digits numbers
 sol : just brute force and store all the palidromes made from multiplication of two three digit number and for each query check the array 
  
 PROBLEM 5 ->  Smallest multiple (MEDIUM)
 ques : number which remainder 0 when divided from 1 to n
 sol : just get all the primes (between 1 to n using sieve of eratosthenes)  and for each values check the max number of times they occur
 then (ans = ans + prime * max_times_prime_occurs in a number)
 
 PROBELEM 6 -> Sum square difference (EASY)
 ques : (a1 + a2 + a3 + ... + an) ^ 2 - (a1 *a1 + a2 * a2 + a3 * a3 + ... + an * an)
 sol : just generate all the value till max_n and answer the query in O(1) time (sum ^ 2 = ((n * (n + 1)) / 2) ^ 2)
 
 PROBLEM 7 -> 10001st prime (EASY)
 ques : nth prime
 sol : just generate all prime less than max_val (using sieve of eratosthenes) and answer query in O(1) time.
 
 PROBLEM 8 -> Largest product in a series (EASY)
 ques : max product of length k in a number(n)
 sol : just do what is asked

 PROBLEM 9 -> Special Pythagorean triplet (EASY)
 ques : checking for pythagorus triplet which have sum equal to n (if exist then max product else -1)
 sol : iterate from 1 to n for i and j and get the third value by sqrt(b * b - a * b) || sqrt(b * b + a * a) and then update the array 
 with sum as index with product as value (here b > a) 
 
 PROBLEM 10 ->  Summation of primes (EASY)
 ques : sum of primes less than or equal to n
 sol : just generate all the prime till n using sieve of eratosthenes and make a array prefix sum to ans the query in O(1) time.
