SOME IMPORTANT SERIES EXPANSION
  1) (1 + x) ^ n (https://undergroundmathematics.org/counting-and-binomials/r6295/solution)

IMPORTANT POINT
* finding primitive root
*  finding primitive root of prime number  = https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/124408/finding-a-primitive-root-of-a-prime-number
      -> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/primitive-problem/problem
* (a + b - 1) / b (for ceil function)
*  when multiplying if the value can be near about 10^18 make sure to divide since overflow can cause the problem (while multiplying)

 ********* FAST EXPONENTATION OR FAST POWER (The Russian Peasant Algorithm)
       -> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/russian-peasant-exponentiation/problem (using formula (a + bi)^k = c + di)
        (make sure to initialize the pair correctly(ans), look for overflow, look for negative value)
         
 ********POWER_MOD WHEN THE VALUE IS GREATER THAN 1O^9 
      was used in primarity testing
      -> https://www.spoj.com/problems/PON/ (prime or not)
 
 **********GCD
 basic gcd problem
   -> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/restaurant/problem (cutting square from rectangle)
   -> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/sherlock-and-gcd/problem
   -> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/possible-path/editorial (EUCLID ALGORITHM)
   -> atcoder 
   -> codechef

good basic geometry problem 
   -> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/sherlock-and-moving-tiles/problem (movement of square in a plane y = x)
   -> https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/most-distant/problem (max_distance between points on x and y axis)



************ EXTENDED EUCLID ALGORITHM
(a + b * x) % n == 0
not include the case when a % n == 0, making the new equation 
(b * x) % n == y 
condition gcd(b, n) = 1, we can get answer by extended euclid algorithm (ax + by = gcd(a, b))
